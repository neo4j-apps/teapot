    "summary": "\n\nEnglish afternoon tea is a light meal typically eaten between 4 pm and 6 pm. Observance of the custom originated amongst the wealthy classes in England in the 1840s. Anna Maria Russell, Duchess of Bedford, is widely credited as transforming afternoon tea in England into a late-afternoon meal whilst visiting Belvoir Castle, though Charles II of England's wife Catherine of Braganza is often credited with introducing tea to the court upon her arrival in 1662. By the end of the nineteenth century, afternoon tea developed to its current form and was observed by both the upper and middle classes: \"the table was laid… there were the best things with a fat pink rose on the side of each cup; hearts of lettuce, thin bread and butter, and the crisp little cakes that had been baked in readiness that morning.\n\nTraditionally, loose tea is brewed in a teapot and served with milk and sugar. The sugar and caffeine of the concoction provided fortification against afternoon doldrums for the working poor of 19th and early 20th century England, who had a significantly lower calorie count and more physically demanding occupation than most westerners today. For labourers, the tea was sometimes accompanied by a small sandwich or baked snack (such as scones) that had been packed for them in the morning. For the more privileged, afternoon tea was accompanied by luxury ingredient sandwiches (customarily cucumber, egg and cress, fish paste, ham, and smoked salmon), scones (with clotted cream and jam, see cream tea) and usually cakes and pastries (such as Battenberg cake, fruit cake or Victoria sponge). In hotels and tea shops, food is often served on a tiered stand; there may be no sandwiches, but bread or scones with butter or margarine and optional jam or other spread, or toast, muffins or crumpets. It was the emergence of afternoon tea that saw Britain regard biscuits as something dunked in tea, a British custom that was later exported around the globe.\n\nIsabella Beeton, whose books on home economics were widely read in the 19th century, describes afternoon teas of various kinds: the old-fashioned tea, the at-home tea, the family tea and the high tea and provides menus. Nowadays, a formal afternoon tea is often taken as a treat in a hotel or tea shop.",

Assam tea (অসমীয়া চাহ, असमिया चाय) is manufactured from the Camellia sinensis var. assamica. This tea, most of which is grown at or near sea level, is known for its body, briskness, malty flavor, and strong, bright color. Assam teas, or blends containing Assam, are often sold as \"breakfast\" teas. Irish breakfast tea for instance, is a maltier and stronger blend among the breakfast blends.\n\nThe state of Assam is the world's largest tea-growing region, lying on either side of the Brahmaputra River, and bordering Bangladesh and Burma (Myanmar). The Assam tea plants are grown in the lowlands of Assam, unlike Darjeeling and Nilgiri tea, which are grown in the highlands. The Assam lowland region is located in the valley of the Brahmaputra River, an area of clay soil rich in nutrients of the floodplain. This part of India experiences high precipitation; during the monsoon period, as much as 10 to 12 inches (250–300 mm) of rain per day. The daytime temperature rises to about 103F (40 °C), creating greenhouse-like conditions of extreme humidity and heat. This tropical climate contributes to Assam's unique malty taste, a feature for which this tea is well known.\n\nThough Assam generally denotes the distinctive black teas from Assam, the region produces smaller quantities of green and white teas as well with their own distinctive characteristics.\n\nHistorically, Assam has been the second commercial tea production region after southern China. Both are the only regions in the world with native tea plants.",

Biluochun is renowned for its delicate appearance with white hairs, fruity taste and floral aroma.\n\nThe name Biluochun literally means \"Green Spring Snail\". The tea is called so because it is rolled into a tight spiral, resembling snail meat and is cropped early spring. Usually, for Biluochun is picked a bud and a leaf.\n\nIts original name is Xia Sha Ren Xiang (嚇煞人香, \"scary fragrance\"). Legend tells of its discovery by a tea picker who ran out of space in her basket and put the tea between her breasts instead. The tea, warmed by her body heat, emitted a strong aroma that surprised the girl.\n\nAccording to the Qing Dynasty chronicle Ye Shi Da Guan, the Kangxi Emperor visited Lake Tai in the 38th year of his rule. At that time, because of its rich aroma, local people called it \"Scary Fragrance\". The Kangxi Emperor decided to give it a more elegant name - Biluochun.\n\nToday, Biluochun is cultivated in Dongting, Jiangsu. Biluochun from Dong Shan (East Mountain) is considered the best. Biluochun is also grown in Zhejiang and Sichuan provinces. Their leaves are larger and less uniform. They taste more nutty than fruity and smooth.\n\nBiluochun is divided into seven grades in decreasing order of quality: Supreme, Supreme Ⅰ,Grade Ⅰ,Grade Ⅱ,Grade Ⅲ, Chao Qing Ⅰ, and Chao Qing Ⅱ.\n\nde:Bilouchun es:Bilouchun",

    "summary": "\n\nBlack tea is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong, green and white teas. All four types are made from leaves of the shrub (or small tree) Camellia sinensis. Black tea is generally stronger in flavor than the less oxidized teas. Two principal varieties of the species are used – the small-leaved Chinese variety plant (''C. sinensis'' subsp. sinensis), used for most other types of teas, and the large-leaved Assamese plant (''C. sinensis'' subsp. assamica), which was traditionally mainly used for black tea, although in recent years some green and white have been produced.\n\nIn Chinese languages and the languages of neighboring countries, black tea is known as \"red tea\" (紅茶], Mandarin Chinese hóngchá; Japanese kōcha; 홍차, Korean hongcha), a description of the colour of the liquid; the Western term \"black tea\" refers to the colour of the oxidized leaves. In Chinese, \"black tea\" is a commonly-used classification for post-fermented teas, such as Pu-erh tea; outside of China and its neighbouring countries, \"red tea\" more commonly refers to rooibos, a South African tisane.\n\nWhile green tea usually loses its flavor within a year, black tea retains its flavour for several years. For this reason, it has long been an article of trade, and compressed bricks of black tea even served as a form of de facto currency in Mongolia, Tibet and Siberia into the 19th century. Although green tea has recently seen a revival due to its purported health benefits, black tea still accounts for over ninety percent of all tea sold in the West.",

The terms chayi \"Art of Tea 茶藝\" and Tea Ceremony have been used, but the term \"Tea Culture 茶文化\" includes more than just the ceremony. Also \"culture\" is easier to translate into English from the Chinese term \"art 藝\".\n\nTea culture in China differs from that of Europe, Britain or Japan in such things as preparation methods, tasting methods and the occasions for which it is consumed. Even now, in both casual and formal Chinese occasions, tea is consumed regularly. In addition to being a drink, Chinese tea is used in traditional Chinese medicine and in Chinese cuisine.",

The number 41022 in this case represents the highest quality while number 8147 consists practically only broken leaves.\n\nChun Mee is not light and sweet like other famous green teas but rather astringent, tart and a bit smoky. The infusion has a pale yellow color. The tea was originally only grown in the Chinese Jiangxi province but nowadays it is also produced in other regions. Chun Mee tea leaves are first steamed and then withered. After withering the leaves are rolled and thereby slightly bent. This typical shape, reminiscent of small eyebrows, gives the tea its name: Chun Mee, English for \"precious eyebrow\".\n\nde:Chun Mee",

    "title": "Crush, Tear, Curl",
    "summary": "Crush, Tear, and Curl (also Cut, Twist, Curl) is a method of processing black tea, similar to that of orthodox tea manufacture. Instead of the leaves being rolled as a final stage, they are passed through a series of cylindrical rollers with hundreds of small sharp \"teeth\" that Crush, Tear, and Curl.\n\nCTC was invented by W. McKertcher during 1930-1931, and the process spread in the 1950s through the 1970s, most rapidly in India and Africa. Today, most black teas produced use the CTC method or the closely related rotovane orthodox manufacture. CTC and rotovane orthodox have a finished product that is well suited for tea bags, as the product quickly gives a dark brew.\n\nFor many large tea producers, 80% to 90% of the factory's production is of small, broken, primary grades suitable for tea bag blends; the remaining 10% to 20% are secondary grades which trade at a discount to the primary grades. The convenience, low price, strong liquor, generic flavor, and mild bitterness all have contributed to the near-monopoly that CTC-type teas now enjoy in South Asia.\n\nIn the Indian domestic market, this type of manufacture is by far the most popular - over 80% of tea production is of the CTC type. In the export market, particularly in the C.I.S., the Middle East, United Kingdom and Ireland, CTC teas continue to be the most highly in demand.\n\nCTC teas generally produce a rich red-brown color when they are boiled by the Indian method. The drawback of the CTC method is that it tends by its nature, and unfortunately by adulteration, to homogenize all black tea flavors. In the process of crushing, tearing and pelletizing the tea leaves, large pressures and stresses occur which break down the cells, releasing large amounts of the phytins that normally oxidize to produce black tea's mahogany color. Since, regardless of origin, CTC teas in their dry form are generically \"tea-like\" in aroma, very similar in pelletized form, it is very easy to adulterate a more expensive CTC-type tea with inexpensive and generally mild lowland teas of the same process. Whole and broken leaf teas by contrast are quite varied in appearance, making adulteration more difficult.\n\nThere is some question whether the CTC processed teas retain much (or any) of the widely referenced polyphenyls and other bio-reactive compounds that are thought to have positive herbal effects.",

Three of these original bushes, growing on a rock on Mount Wuyi and reportedly dates back to the Song Dynasty, still survive today and are highly venerated.\n\nIn recent years, a number of companies have invested in preserving the interest in this tea and other so-called \"artisan\" teas, which typically are of very high quality and have rich histories as is true with Da Hong Pao. These have an initially high cost of production (and typically are only considered authentic when grown in their place of origin), but, as they have quickly become popular in Western countries, prized selections of the tea are available each year, with quality being consistent due to the increased popularity of tea.\n\nCuttings taken from the original plants have been used to produce similar grades of tea from genetically identical plants. Taste variations produced by processing, differences in the soil, and location of these later generation plants is used to grade the quality of various Da Hong Pao teas.\n\nDue to its high quality, Da Hong Pao tea is usually reserved for honored guests in China.",

However, this area has long been used for tea cultivation. Production is now scarce and quality varies. Many Dong Ding nowadays are produced from other Nantou high mountain tea and follow the traditional Dong Ding production method. Dong Ding is typically medium roasted (about 30%).\n\nDong Ding is still primarily hand-picked and is either charcoal or machine roasted.

Green tea originates in China, but it has become associated with many cultures throughout Asia. Green tea has recently become more widespread in the West, where black tea has been the traditionally consumed tea. Green tea has become the raw material for extracts which are used in various beverages, health foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetic items. Many varieties of green tea have been created in the countries where it is grown. These varieties can differ substantially due to variable growing conditions, horticulture, production processing, and harvesting time.\n\nOver the last few decades green tea has been subjected to many scientific and medical studies to determine the extent of its long-purported health benefits, with some evidence suggesting that regular green tea drinkers may have a lower risk of developing heart disease and certain types of cancer. Although green tea does not raise the metabolic rate enough to produce immediate weight loss, a green tea extract containing polyphenols and caffeine has been shown to induce thermogenesis and stimulate fat oxidation, boosting the metabolic rate 4% without increasing the heart rate.\n\nAccording to a survey released by the United States Department of Agriculture in 2007, the mean content of flavonoids in a cup of green tea is higher than that in the same volume of other food and drink items that are traditionally considered of health contributing nature, including fresh fruits, vegetable juices or wine. Flavonoids are a group of phytochemicals in most plant products that are responsible for such health effects as anti-oxidative and anticarcinogenic functions.",

The taste is light and flowery and sometimes referred to milk. This tea variety can be grown at higher attitudes and the yield is about 20% higher compared to traditional tea varieties. These circumstances made it become one of the most popular varieties among tea farmers in Taiwan and Thailand. The widely advertised milky flavor of Jin Xuan is not natural but is added by aromatization. Reputable dealers usually declare whether it is a natural or flavored oolong. A flavored Jin Xuan can be recognized before the tea is steeped. The added flavors mask the natural tea flavor significantly.",

It is more commonly named 正山小种 in Chinese (zhèng shān xiǎo zhǒng) and Japanese (seisanshōshu). It is sometimes referred to as smoked tea (熏茶). Lapsang is distinct from all other types of tea because lapsang leaves are traditionally smoke-dried over pinewood fires, taking on a distinctive smoky flavour.\n\nLapsang souchong is the first black tea in history, even earlier than the famous Keemun tea. After the lapsang souchong tea was used for producing black tea called Min Hong (meaning \"Black tea produced in Fujian\"), people started to move the tea bush to different places like Keemun, India and Ceylon.\n\nXiǎozhǒng (小種) means \"sub-variety\". Lapsang souchong is a member of the Wuyi tea family of teas. Wuyi is the mountain area producing a large family of tea in South-East China). The story goes that the tea was created during the Qing era when the passage of armies delayed the annual drying of the tea leaves in the Wuyi Mountain. Eager to satisfy demand, the tea producers sped up the drying process by having their workers dry the tea leaves over fires made from local pines.\n\nLapsang souchong from the original source is increasingly expensive, as Wuyi is a small area and there is increasing demand for this variety of tea.",

Most oolong teas, especially those of fine quality, involve unique tea plant cultivars that are exclusively used for particular varieties. The degree of oxidation can range from 8% - 80% depending on the variety and production style. This tea category is especially popular with tea connoisseurs of south China and Chinese expatriates in Southeast Asia, as is the tea preparation process that originated from this area: gongfu tea-making, or the gongfu tea infusion approach.\n\nIn Chinese tea culture, semi-oxidised oolong teas are collectively grouped as qīngchá. The taste of oolong ranges hugely amongst various subvarieties. It can be sweet and fruity with honey aromas or woody and thick with roasted aromas, or green and fresh with bouquet aromas, all depending on the horticulture and style of production. Several subvarieties of oolong, including those produced in the Wuyi Mountains of northern Fujian, such as Da Hong Pao, are among the most famous Chinese teas.\n\nDifferent varieties of oolong are processed differently, but the leaves are formed into one of two distinct styles. Some are rolled into long curly leaves, while others are 'wrap-curled' into small beads, each with a tail. The former style is the more traditional of the two.\n\nThe name oolong tea came into the English language from the Chinese name (烏龍茶), meaning \"black dragon tea\". Other possible descriptions are \"blue tea\" (from Qing Cha) or \"semi-fermented tea\" (although it's oxidized and not fermented).",

    "summary": "\n\nPu-erh tea (普洱茶), also spelled as pu'er tea, is a variety of fermented tea produced in Yunnan province, China. Fermentation is a tea production style in which the tea leaves undergo microbial fermentation and oxidation after they are dried and rolled. This process is a Chinese specialty and produces tea known as Hei Cha (黑茶), commonly translated to dark, or black tea (this type of tea is completely different from what in West is known as \"black tea\", which in China is called \"red tea\"). The most famous variety of this category of tea is Pu-erh from Yunnan Province, named after the trading post for dark tea during imperial China. Real Pu-Erh tea is made of tea leaves harvested of hughe tea trees called Qimao. Initially it was assumed that thoes trees are just very tall Assam bushes but recent DNA test showed that it's an entire new species. The discoverer named this plant Camellia taliensis to honor the Dai (Thai) minority which uses this plant traditionally to produce tea. .\n\nPu-erh traditionally begins as a raw product known as \"rough\" Mao Cha (毛茶) and can be sold in this form or pressed into a number of shapes and sold as \"raw\" Sheng Cha (生茶). Both of these forms then undergo the complex process of gradual fermentation and maturation with time. The recently developed Wo Dui process (渥堆) pioneered by both the Menghai and Kunming Tea Factories has created a new type of pu-erh tea that some traditionalists dispute the legitimacy of. This process involves an accelerated fermentation into \"ripe\" Shou Cha (熟茶) which is then sold loose or pressed in various shapes. All types or pu-erh can be stored for maturity before consumption and that is why it has become common for the products to be labelled with year and region of production.",

Tea bags are commonly made of paper, silk or plastic. The bag contains the tea leaves while the tea is brewed, making it easier to dispose of the leaves, and performs the same function as a tea infuser. Some tea bags have an attached piece of string with a paper label at the top that assists in removing the bag while also identifying the variety of tea.\n\nIn countries where the use of loose tea leaves is more prevalent, the term tea bag is commonly used to describe paper or foil packaging for loose leaves. They are usually square or rectangular envelopes with the brand name, flavour and decorative patterns printed on them.\n\nde:Teebeutel",

They had such a hugely positive effect on morale they became commonplace in all areas of work. They were present in a works canteen or perhaps came round with a trolley full of either hot tea or hot water, and perhaps a selection of cakes and buns.",

These differences can be tasted by a trained taster in order to ascertain the quality prior to sale or possibly blending tea.\n\nA tea taster uses a large spoon and noisily slurps the liquid into his/her mouth - this ensures that both the tea and plenty of oxygen is passed over all the taste receptors on the tongue to give an even taste profile of the tea. The liquid is then usually spat back out into a spitoon before moving onto the next sample to taste. The flavour characteristics and indeed leaf colour, size and shape are graded using a specific language created by the tea industry to explain the overall quality. Generally speaking, once the quality has been tasted/graded, each tea company places a value on it based on market trends, availability and demand.",

Tetsubin are often elaborately decorated with relief designs on the outside. They range widely in size, and many have unusual shapes and are therefor popular with collectors. A relatively small tetsubin may hold around .5 litres of water while large ones may hold up to 5 litres.\n\nThe historical origin of the tetsubin is not certain. At least one authoritative Japanese source states that it developed from the spouted and handled water kettle called tedorigama that was already being used in tea ceremony during the 15th century in the era of Sen no Rikyu (1522–91). During the 19th century, infused tea became more popular and tetsubin were considered primarily status symbols rather than functional kitchen items. There is also a kind of relatively small cast iron pot that resembles a tetsubin but is glazed with enamel on the inside in order to lend itself to making brewed tea, and is referred to as an iron kyusu or teapot.",

This tea is sweetened with sugar and condensed milk and served chilled. Evaporated milk, coconut milk or whole milk is generally poured over the tea and ice before serving to add taste and creamy appearance. However, in Thailand, condensed milk and sugar are mixed with the tea before it is poured over ice and then topped with evaporated milk. At markets, it can be seen to be mixed through pouring the tea at heights of about 4 feet back and forth. This show is part of the selling strategy but there are also professional held competition in making iced tea.\n\nIt is popular in Southeast Asia and in many American restaurants that serve Thai food. Although Thai tea is not the same as bubble tea, a beverage that contains large tapioca pearls, Thai tea with tapioca pearls is a popular flavor of bubble tea.\n\nAs refrigeration and condensed milk are only recent phenomena, it may be thought that tea has only been drank in Thailand in the last 100 years or so. This is not the case.\n\nIn fact, Northern Thailand produces some of the finest loose leaf teas available, and which challenge the more commonly known producers of camellia sinensis such as China, Japan and Taiwan.\n\nTheir varietal produces some of the finest oolong teas which are made with Taiwanese tea varietals.

Okakura had been taught at a young age to speak English and was proficient at communicating his thoughts to the Western mind. In his book, he discusses such topics as Zen and Taoism, but also the secular aspects of tea and Japanese life. The book emphasizes how Teaism taught the Japanese many things; most importantly, simplicity. Kakuzō argues that this tea-induced simplicity affected art and architecture, and he was a long-time student of the visual arts. He ends the book with a chapter on Tea Masters, and spends some time talking about Sen no Rikyū and his contribution to the Japanese Tea Ceremony.\n\nAccording to Tomonobu Imamichi, Heidegger’s concept of Dasein in Sein und Zeit was inspired &mdash; although Heidegger remains silent on this &mdash; by Okakura Kakuzō’s concept of das-in-der-Welt-sein (being-in-the-worldness) expressed in The Book of Tea to describe Zhuangzi’s philosophy, which Imamichi’s teacher had offered to Heidegger in 1919, after having followed lessons with him the year before.",

He refused to take up the monastic robes and was assigned menial jobs by his stepfather. Lu Yu ran away and joined the circus as a clown. At age 14, Lu Yu was discovered by the local governor Li Qiwu who offered Lu Yu the use of his library and the opportunity to study with a teacher. During the An Lushan and Shi Siming rebellion period, Lu Yu retired to Shaoqi (now Wuxing county, Zhejiang). During this period, Lu Yu made friends with many literati, including the calligrapher Yan Zhenqing and the poet Huang Pu Zheng and wrote his masterpiece: Ch'a Ching.\n\nFor Lu Yu, tea symbolized the harmony and mysterious unity of the Universe. \"He invested the Ch'a Ching with the concept that dominated the religious thought of his age, whether Buddhist, Taoist, or Confucian: to see in the particular an expression of the universal\" (Shapira, et al., 150).",

More specifically, this compound is called  L -theanine, being the L- amino acid (not to be confused with a levorotatory enantiomer). In 1950, the tea laboratory of Kyoto successfully separated theanine from gyokuro leaf, which has high theanine content. Theanine is an analog to glutamine and glutamate, and can cross the blood–brain barrier. It is sold in the US as a dietary supplement, and is classified by the FDA as a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) ingredient.

In addition to serving as a beverage, many tisanes are also consumed due to a perceived medicinal benefit.\n\nLike beverages made from the tea bush (Camellia sinensis), tisanes can be served hot or cold. Tisanes have been used for nearly as long as written history extends. Documents have been recovered dating back to as early as Ancient Egypt and Ancient China that discuss the enjoyment and uses of tisanes. Among the Chinese, tisanes are commonly known as liang cha.",
